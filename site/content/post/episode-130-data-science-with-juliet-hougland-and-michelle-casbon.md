[Juliet Hougland](https://twitter.com/j_houg) and [Michelle Casbon](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle) are on the podcast this week to talk about data science with [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic). We had a great discussion about methodology, applications, tools, pipelines, challenges and resources. Juliet shared insights into the unique data science ownership workflow from idea to deployment at Stitch Fix, and Michelle dove into how Kubeflow is playing a role to help drive reliability in model development and deployment.

##### Juliet Hougland

[Juliet Hougland](https://twitter.com/j_houg)  leads the Workflow, Environment, and Execution team at [Stichfix](https://www.stitchfix.com/). She is a data scientist and engineer with expertise in computational mathematics and years of hands-on machine learning and big data experience. She has built and deployed production ML models, advised Fortune 500 companies on infrastructure and worked on a variety of open source projects (Apache Spark, Scalding, and Kiji) at the intersection of big data and machine learning.

##### Michelle Casbon

[Michelle Casbon](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle) is a Senior Engineer on the Google Cloud Platform Developer Relations team, where she focuses on open source contributions and community engagement for machine learning and big data tools. Prior to joining Google, she was at several San Francisco-based startups as a Senior Engineer and Director of Data Science. Within these roles, she built and shipped machine learning products on distributed platforms using both AWS and GCP. Michelle’s development experience spans more than a decade and has primarily focused on multilingual natural language processing, system architecture and integration, and continuous delivery pipelines for machine learning applications. She especially loves working with open source projects and is an active contributor to Kubeflow. Michelle holds a masters degree from the University of Cambridge.
