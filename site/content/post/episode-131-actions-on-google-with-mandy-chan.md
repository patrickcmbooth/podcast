##### Mandy Chan

[Mandy Chan](https://twitter.com/mandychannyc) is the developer community manager for the Actions On Google team. Her role is to help expand the funnel of the Actions on Google developer community by creating practical tools and content like [http://bit.ly/aog-codelab-1](http://bit.ly/aog-codelab-1) and  [http://bit.ly/aog-codelab-2](http://bit.ly/aog-codelab-2) 

Mandy began to build voice applications back in early 2016, and since then, she has built more than a dozen Voice Applications on Actions On Google and other platforms. One of her most frequently downloaded open source projects is called the SSML-Builder which creates well-formed Speech Synthesis Markup Language without worrying about string concatenation. You can learn more about her open source project on [http://bit.ly/ssml-build](http://bit.ly/ssml-build)

When she is not pondering about how to improve the developer experience, you can find her hiking at mountains or learning new magic tricks. You can also learn more about  Mandy by following [@MandyChanNYC](https://twitter.com/mandychannyc?lang=en)
